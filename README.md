# Graph Implementation and Algorithms - Darsh Chaurasia

## Overview

This repository contains C++ implementations of various graph-related algorithms and data structures. It includes classes and functions to work with graphs represented as matrices, priority queues, and min-max heaps.

## Files

### 1. `Chaurasia_TestGraph.cpp`
This is the main file that contains test cases for the graph implementation. It demonstrates the functionality of the graph algorithms and data structures provided in this repository.

### 2. `MatrixGraph_Chaurasia.cpp`
This file contains the implementation of the `MatrixGraph` class, which represents a graph using an adjacency matrix. This class provides methods for graph traversal, adding/removing edges, and other graph operations.

### 3. `MatrixGraph_Chaurasia.h`
This is the header file for `MatrixGraph_Chaurasia.cpp`. It defines the `MatrixGraph` class, including all its methods and member variables.

### 4. `minmaxheap_chaurasia.hpp`
This file implements a min-max heap, a specialized data structure that allows efficient retrieval of both the minimum and maximum elements. This is particularly useful for certain graph algorithms that require priority queue operations.

### 5. `Queue_Chaurasia.hpp`
This file contains the implementation of a custom queue class used in various graph algorithms. It provides basic queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, and checking if the queue is empty.

### 6. `Makefile`
The `Makefile` is used for compiling the project. It provides a simple way to compile all the source files and generate the executable.

### 7. `metadata.yml`
This file contains metadata about the submission, including the author's name, email, and submission timestamp.

## Compilation

To compile the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make
```

## Running the Program

After compiling the project, you can run the program using the following command: `./your_executable_name`
Replace your_executable_name with the actual name of the executable generated by the Makefile.

## Dependencies

C++11 or higher
A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
